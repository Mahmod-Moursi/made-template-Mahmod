## Title

Climate Change Analysis: Understanding the Relationship between Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Temperature Anomalies

## Main Question

1. What is the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature anomalies across different countries, and how does it vary based on regional, economic, and climatic factors?

## Description

Climate change is a pressing global issue with far-reaching implications for ecosystems, economies, and human well-being. This project aims to analyze the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature anomalies using data-driven methods. By examining emissions and temperature data from multiple countries, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and potential causal relationships. Insights gained from this analysis can inform policy decisions, mitigation strategies, and adaptation measures to address climate change effectively.

In selecting countries for analysis, we considered several factors such as geographical diversity, economic significance, emissions intensity, and data availability. The chosen countries represent a range of regions, economic statuses, and emissions profiles, providing a comprehensive perspective on the global dynamics of climate change. Specifically, we have chosen:

- United States: Major emitter, highly industrialized.
- China: World's largest emitter, significant economic influence.
- India: Rapidly growing economy, populous nation.
- Brazil: Rich biodiversity, deforestation concerns.
- Germany: Leading in renewable energy adoption.
- Russia: Major fossil fuel producer.
- Japan: Highly industrialized, advanced technology.
- South Africa: Developing country with coal reliance.
- Australia: Reliant on fossil fuels, vulnerable to climate impacts.
- Canada: Abundant natural resources, emissions from oil extraction.

This diverse set of countries provides a rich dataset for analyzing the complex interactions between emissions, temperature anomalies, and socio-economic factors.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Annual Temperature Anomalies
* Metadata URL: N/A
* Data URL: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-temperature-anomalies
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains annual temperature anomaly data for various countries over a specified time period. Each record includes information such as the country, year, and temperature anomaly.

### Datasource2: Per Capita Greenhouse Gas Emissions
* Metadata URL: N/A
* Data URL: https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/co2?facet=none&country=DEU~USA~ZAF~RUS~CHN~JPN~IND~CAN~BRA~AUS&hideControls=false&Gas+or+Warming=All+GHGs+%28CO%E2%82%82eq%29&Accounting=Production-based&Fuel+or+Land+Use+Change=All+fossil+emissions&Count=Per+capita
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides per capita greenhouse gas emissions data for different countries over a specified time period. Each record includes information such as the country, year, and emissions in CO2 equivalents.
