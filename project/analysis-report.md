        <br/><br/>
    - **Findings:**
    - **China:** Highest coefficient, strong link between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This suggests that any increase in energy consumption leads to a significant increase in CO2 emissions.
    - **United States, Russia, India:** Strong positive coefficients, significant impact of energy consumption on CO2 emissions.
    - **Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Canada:** Moderate coefficients, moderate impact on CO2 emissions.
    - **Japan, Australia:** smaller impact on CO2 emissions, likely due to efficient energy use or cleaner energy sources.
    <!-- - **Implications:** High-coefficient countries should enhance energy efficiency and adopt cleaner energy sources, while low-coefficient countries, already mitigating CO2 impact, can serve as models for others. -->

- **GDP Coefficient Comparison:**
